00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:09,340
So now that we had a first look at stencil.js and we have a general idea of why we want to use

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,100
it and how we can create a new project with it,

3
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:19,630
let's finally dive into the basics about stencil.js. How we use it, how we use its special syntax,

4
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:26,140
this JSX thing, how we use Typescript in case you're not familiar with Typescript, we'll dive into

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:32,320
all these things in this module and we will learn how we can start building web components with stencil.js

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:32,890
