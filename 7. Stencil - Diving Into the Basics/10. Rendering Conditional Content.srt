1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:03,780
Now this is all great.

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:09,660
Now one thing is missing though, we can't really open or hide our drawer,

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,550
right now it's always visible.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,960
Now there are various ways of making sure we can open and hide it, one would be to add a new prop, the

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:24,650
open prop maybe which is a boolean and let's say and this is true or false obviously.

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:32,600
Now we can use such a property outside now as an attribute and how could we use it?

7
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,840
Well we could for example wrap all our content here into a conditional statement to only render this

8
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,630
if this is true.

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:49,100
This also shows you how you can render content conditionally in this JSX syntax, it's easier than

10
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,410
you might think.

11
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:56,340
I'll simply add a new variable here in the render function, content and by default, this is null,

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,190
so no content

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,470
but if this is open, so this is a boolean so checking this will, well either see it is true and then go

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,250
into the if block or it's false and we'll skip it.

15
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:16,310
If this is true though, I'll set content equal to what I previously rendered in all cases.

16
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,820
So I'll just copy that and store this in the variable,

17
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,730
you can store JSX code in variables because behind the scenes, this is just normal Javascript code,

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,500
just looking a little bit more appealing and easier to work with

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:37,900
and then here, I return the content and the content now either is null or our own JSX code.

20
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,060
So now we don't see anything because by default, we don't have open set to true.

21
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:49,160
If I interact with my side drawer though and you might need to reload the page for this to work and I

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,600
simply add this open attribute and I don't even need to set it to true,

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,850
adding it like this already counts as true,

24
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,510
then you see I can see my side drawer.

25
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,960
So this is a nice way of toggling its display state

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:05,930
and this is one possible way of ensuring that we can see it.
