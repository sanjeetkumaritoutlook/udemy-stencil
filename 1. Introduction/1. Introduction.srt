00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:08,260
Welcome on board of this course, I'm very happy that you joined me in this course because in this course, we'll

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,700
dive into a super exciting topic,

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,990
we'll dive into web components.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,780
You will learn how to build your own custom HTML elements with features that are already baked into

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:22,390
browsers and into modern Javascript.

6
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:26,930
You will not need any other third party library or framework,

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,550
you will not need Angular or React or JQuery,

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,760
you will learn a technology or you will learn about a technology that works as you see it in this course

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:42,430
out of the box. In this course, you will not just learn everything about web components from scratch

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,250
and we will write plenty of web components like a modal or a side drawer,

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:53,250
you will not just learn about these features in this course, you will also learn about a tool, stencil.js

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,220
that also spits out native web components but makes the development of these way easier even.

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,470
So you will learn about the vanilla Javascript web components and then you will learn an even easier

14
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,750
way of developing such components with the help of stencil.js.

15
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,710
And you will learn how to build your own custom elements, like your own custom modal or side drawer,

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,990
all things we will build in this course to learn about the different features that make up these custom

17
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,120
elements step-by-step.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,860
So let's dive into the most important question first,

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,750
what in detail are web components before I then give you an overview of the course and we then dive deeply

20
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,660
into web components and everything that makes up web components.
