00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:09,400
Now with basics about stencil.js covered and our first component being built, let's dive into the a little

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,220
more advanced features, features that we might not need in every single component we're building

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:21,970
but certainly in a decent amount of them. We'll dive into the lifecycle of stencil components, into

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:30,280
emitting custom events and listening to events in different ways and into writing more reactive stencil

5
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,530
components that can adapt to changing circumstances in an easier way.

6
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:36,420
So let's dive in.
