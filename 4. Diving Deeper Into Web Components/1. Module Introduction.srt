00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,860
So now that we explored the basics about web components and how we generally can get started working with

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,440
them, how we can get started building them, now that we did that,

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,150
I want to dive into some more advanced features or into well, the advanced basics you could call it.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,130
So basically into the other things, the next steps you need to know about building web components.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,840
And in this module, we'll have a detailed look at how we can work with these slots

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,730
we already started working with, how we can react to changes in our attributes and how we can also work on

7
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:46,360
the styling side to make sure our components, our custom elements look the way we want them to look like.

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:48,840
So let's dive into all these things step by step.
