1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:05,230
So that is web components and how you can use them.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:10,600
We now saw how we can build our projects and get that that dist output here, how we can drag and drop

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,450
that into a project if we want to import it with script tags like this, how we can alternatively publish

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,810
it to npm though to have it published there either publicly or if we have a paid private account, we can

5
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:29,980
also publish it privately to only share it amongst our different projects or inside of our company and how

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:36,810
we can then install this with npm install into any project that is managed by npm and then make it work,

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:43,720
for example in our Angular app with adjustments to the main.ts file by defining the elements and our

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:50,350
app module by informing Angular about the fact that we're using custom elements. How we can make it in

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:56,830
React alternatively, to be able to use it there too by simply defining the elements in index.js file

10
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:58,880
after adding them,

11
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,740
for example with npm install and how we can also make our components work by also defining them in a Vue

12
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,180
project here in the main.js file,

13
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:14,110
so before we mount our root component. If you want to learn more about React, Vue or Angular, definitely

14
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,030
have a look at my dedicated courses,

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:21,880
I got courses on all these projects but now you know how you can use your stencil build web components

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,960
in any of these projects.
