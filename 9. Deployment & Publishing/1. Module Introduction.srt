00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:06,620
Now that we had a very detailed look at the web components in general

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:11,660
and stencil.js in detail which helps you building these web components,

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:18,860
let's have a look at how we can actually deploy and publish and share our web components, across

4
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:25,730
our own projects as well as with other people because that is one core advantage of web components after

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,020
all.

6
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,750
We can easily drop them into any other project to add that piece of functionality which we encapsulated

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,720
in our web component.

8
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,160
Now for this, we'll build our stencil web components, so we'll generate these native web components and I'll

9
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:50,180
then show you different ways of using those generated web components in different projects and how to

10
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,910
get them into different projects.
