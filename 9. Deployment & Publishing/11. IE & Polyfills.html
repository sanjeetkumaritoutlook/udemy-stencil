<p>At this point of time, the automatic polyfill-loading of Stencil.js-generated components unfortunately is a bit buggy when it comes to  CSS properties and IE11. See this issue thread: <a href="https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/1257" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/issues/1257</a></p><p>Though, as you can tell by the discussion in this thread, we might never see a fix for that bug.</p><p>So if you need to support IE11 right now, it's best to not use CSS properties or bring your own polyfill.</p>
