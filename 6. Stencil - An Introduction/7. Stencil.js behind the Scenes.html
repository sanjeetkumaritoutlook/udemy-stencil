<p>Stencil.js spits out native, vanilla-JS web components. </p><p>BUT: These components have (vanilla) JavaScript added to them that enhances the web component experience by:</p><ul><li><p>Loading component code lazily (i.e. source code gets only pulled into the page if it's really needed =&gt; This reduces the overall bundle size)</p></li><li><p>Loading required polyfills automatically for browsers that need it</p></li><li><p>Re-rendering the web (component) DOM efficiently (i.e. the DOM gets updated with as minimal impact as possible, to reduce the amount of work JS and the browser have to do)</p></li></ul>
