00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:09,950
So over the last modules, we had a very close look at all the basics you need to have set to build your

2
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:18,710
own web components, your own custom HTML elements. And now that we built our first HTML elements and

3
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,400
used a broad variety of features that help us with that,

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:30,800
the obvious question is, how do we get these custom HTML elements we built for us here into the different

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,650
projects we might be building or into the projects of other people,

6
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,500
how can we deploy our web component

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,580
so to say? Now towards the end of the course, I will have a detailed deployment module where I will show

8
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:53,540
you things like how to publish your own libraries to npm and what npm is, is something we'll learn

9
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,320
until then.

10
00:00:54,530 --> 00:01:02,360
So a detailed deployment module will come later at the course after we covered stencil because maybe

11
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:08,420
you already wondered what's this stencil thing which is mentioned in the course title. Well we'll have

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:13,760
a look at it right now and we will understand why it can be helpful,

13
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,580
it is a tool that helps us with building web components

14
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,440
and here is why we might want to use it.
