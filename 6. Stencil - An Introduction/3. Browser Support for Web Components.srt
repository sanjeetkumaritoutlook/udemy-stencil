00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:09,970
I already mentioned that you can google for can I use and then custom elements or shadow DOM and you

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:17,320
should find a search result from caniuse.com, here for shadow DOM V1 and if we inspect this,

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,060
we see Firefox is great,

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,170
Chrome is great,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,200
Safari has partial support but that is getting better

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,990
but Edge and Internet Explorer is not that great.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:38,800
If you search for web components browser support instead of can I use, then you'll find this webcomponents.org

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:46,270
and on that page if you scroll down, you indeed find this browser support table which clearly

9
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,230
shows us that Edge and Internet Explorer is not even mentioned here

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:53,260
does not natively support all these features yet,

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,890
custom elements in the shadow DOM need to be polyfilled there.

12
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:03,130
Now in case you don't know what that is, a polyfill is basically an extra script file you import which

13
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:10,880
then basically adds certain features, rebuilds certain features in the browser,

14
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:17,980
it's obviously seldom as good as the official implementation but at least, it gets your project, your

15
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,810
web component working. And on webcomponents.org,

16
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:27,670
you actually find that polyfills section which you can click where you can find detailed instructions

17
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:35,110
on what you need to install and how you can get started with polyfills to make your web components

18
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:40,530
work in Internet Explorer and Edge too and definitely read through that resource

19
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,260
if you want to make your web component as we built it here

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,100
work in Edge and in Internet Explorer. To be precise,

21
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,800
you will find

22
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:57,330
a lecture after this one where I give you some starting hints on how you can make this component work

23
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:57,810
there.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,390
However it's not really worth the effort because stencil.js, this tool into which we'll dive in a second

25
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,560
will make his whole deployment and distribution process way easier and will ensure that our web components

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:18,340
work in all major browsers out of the box without us needing to do any special extra setup. So that will

27
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,100
be awesome

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,640
and that is one reason why we dive into stencil. To see the other reason as well,

29
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,730
let's create a new stencil project.
