1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,510
To use stencil.js, we need to download NodeJS from nodejs.org.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,500
Now we will not write any NodeJS

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,040
code, NodeJS

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,730
is a Javascript runtime which allows you to write Javascript server side code.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,590
We will not write any of that but NodeJS is used behind the scenes by stencil which is a build tool

6
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,240
for web components in the end,

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,350
it runs some scripts that are using NodeJS features to basically give us a way of creating web components

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:39,680
that is more convenient and then compile that code to native web component code and NodeJS

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:47,150
also installs with another package, the npm, the Node Package Manager, a tool which allows us to install

10
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:54,410
tools and dependencies of tools on our machine and inside of projects and stencil will be such a tool installed

11
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,730
through npm.

12
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:59,620
So your first step is to simply install the latest version of NodeJS,

13
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,440
in my case 11.2 but pick whatever latest version you have,

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,400
click on this,

15
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,410
it works on all operating systems,

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:11,270
it should automatically select your operating system here and you can simply walk through the installer

17
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,300
this download gives you to then install NodeJS and npm on your machine.

18
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,400
Once you did install NodeJS, you should have npm installed,

19
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:27,560
so you should now be able to run the npm command here and we'll use this command to create a new stencil

20
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,190
project,

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,050
you don't need to install anything else, it will all be installed on the fly.

22
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:37,850
First of all, navigate into a folder where you want to create that new project and with project, I mean

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:43,190
a project which we will use to build web components which we then can use in any other project.

24
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:50,540
So here I already navigated into such a folder and now you can run npm init and then stencil and if

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:58,850
you hit enter, it will automatically install stencil on the fly and then you will see this prompt here and

26
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:05,120
there, you should choose component to create a new project used for building web components.

27
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,570
You can also build whole applications with stencil,

28
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:13,440
this simply means that you build multiple web components that work together to build an entire app

29
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:19,280
but here, we'll just build a component library which not necessarily gives us a front-end web app but a

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,070
collection of components we can use anywhere.

31
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,260
Hit enter there and give your project a name, I'll name it web-components-stencil

32
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,660
but you can choose any name you want,

33
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,670
confirm this with a Y and thereafter, navigate into this newly created,

34
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,890
in my case, web components stencil folder.

35
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,430
Now you can run npm start to start a simple development server which spins up an index.html file that

36
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:48,230
loads a default web component which gets created out of the box

37
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:54,410
but here, let's simply open that project in our IDE first of all to see what we get there and how

38
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,080
building web components with stencil looks like.
