00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:09,290
With all the core basics out of the way, let's dive into building more complex components or one more

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,960
complex component in this module. We'll build a modal component,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,350
so like this pop-up, this overlay inside of a page with a nice backdrop behind it where we can pass

4
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,220
our own content into it and which we can also configure,

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,530
for example where we can control from outside whether it's shown or not.

6
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:36,740
We'll also learn how we can dispatch our own events from inside our web component so that we can react

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,290
to these custom events outside of it

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,570
and we'll see a lot of the features you already learned about in the last modules in action too.

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,280
So a great practice as well as many exciting new features,

10
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,170
let's dive in.
