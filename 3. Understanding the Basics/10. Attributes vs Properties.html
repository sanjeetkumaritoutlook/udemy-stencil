<p>A common mistake is to confuse <strong>HTML attributes</strong> and <strong>DOM object properties</strong>.</p><p>First of all, it's important to understand that the browser essentially "translates" your HTML code to a tree of DOM nodes (= objects if you access them in JavaScript).</p><p>A HTML tag can have an attribute and the "DOM objects" (JavaScript objects for DOM nodes) can (and most likely will) have properties. Often, attributes and properties are linked.</p><p>For example, an <code>&lt;input value="Starting value"&gt;</code> element has a <code>value</code> attribute. If you access that element via JavaScript, its respective objects representation also has a <code>value</code> property. Behind the scenes, the <code>value</code> attribute and <code>value</code> property are kind of linked.</p><p>Other objects have <strong>no attribute equivalents</strong> though. For example, you can set <code>aria-</code> attributes (for accessibility: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA</a>) on HTML elements. These attributes have no linked properties since they're only required in the markup for screen-readers to read them. </p><p>And even for the <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element, it's not as simple as it might seem. If you change the value property programmatically, you will notice that the attribute <code>value</code> (which you can see in your browser dev tools) does not reflect that change. So it's a one-way route for this attribute basically.</p><p>We'll dive deeper into this throughout the course and you will learn how to set attributes, properties and how to synchronize them. </p><p><strong>For now, it's just important to keep in mind that HTML attributes and DOM properties CAN be connected but don't have to. They're not the same.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://udemy-images.s3.amazonaws.com:443/redactor/raw/2018-11-27_17-57-37-f08ed4fde94fa1492a2859c42d9e3ef0.png"></figure>
