00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:02,990
Now

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:08,240
another important topic which is only partly related to next gen Javascript

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,100
and you really should already know that

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,080
is that Javascript of course is able to handle asynchronous code.

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:17,950
Let's say you are sending an HTTP request from inside your Javascript app,

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,440
then there are different solutions like callbacks or promises to handle the response of that asynchronous

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:32,540
task or of this HTTP request without blocking code execution of your code until the response is there.

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:36,870
Now I can only recommend this article to which you find a link attached to this video,

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,770
if you want to learn more about async code in Javascript and different solutions to it,

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,820
in this course, we'll use promises at a later point of time, so you should be able to understand that and

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,200
you also find other resources on that. In case you don't

12
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,190
know promises and you really need to learn it from scratch,

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,130
take a look at those resources,

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,200
otherwise just take them as a reference in case something is unclear

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,340
at a later point of time.
