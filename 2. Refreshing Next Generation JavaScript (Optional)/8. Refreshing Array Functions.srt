00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,220
Another thing you will see quite a lot in this course are array functions,

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,150
let me quickly show you what I mean.

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,330
The good old numbers array with 1, 2 and 3,

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,690
now let's say we want to turn this into an array where each number is doubled,

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,310
so we have the doubleNum array, something like that,

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,760
we can use an array function for this,

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,220
we can take the numbers array and call map.

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,440
Map is a built-in array method and there are many of these methods,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,430
I will use quite a lot of them and they're not next generation Javascript, all these methods work in

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,940
the same way though. They take a function as an input and this function which is an arrow function here

11
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:55,420
but could be a normal function is then simply executed on each element in the array here,

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,180
so on each element in the numbers array, on 1 and 2 and 3.

13
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,550
So therefore, what we get in this arrow function is a number in the end

14
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,610
but you can name this argument whatever you want, here

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,740
we can then simply return something

16
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,000
and what you have to do in this internal function depends on which array function you are using,

17
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:24,810
check the docs in places like the Mozilla Developer Network docs to learn more about the available array functions.

18
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:30,500
So in the map function, we have to return the new value we want to turn the old one into,

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,760
so we could return num times two

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,820
and since this is executed on every element here,

21
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,230
it will return 2, 4 and 6 and conveniently map also returns

22
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,240
a new array,

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,080
so a real new array which is then stored in doubleNum array.

24
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:58,350
So now if I output numbers and thereafter doubleNum array like this and I now hit run, you'll

25
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:05,580
see the old one is unchanged but the new one holds double the values and I will explain what these

26
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,110
functions do when we use them in the course,

27
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,880
I just want to bring them to your attention right now,

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:17,100
explain that they always have this function which gets executed on each element and that they are not

29
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,480
next generation Javascript but normal Javascript actually. Be prepared to meet them,

30
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,970
I will explain what they do when we see them and always feel free to dive into docs like the Mozilla

31
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:30,370
Developer Network to learn more about them.
