1
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,350
This is a totally optional module.

2
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:15,100
If you're up to date with ES6+ Javascript features like arrow functions, let and const or with general

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:22,300
important Javascript basics like how to work with array and the built-in array methods and things like

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:22,720
that,

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,500
then you may absolutely skip this module. In this course,

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,170
we'll use both Javascript and later also a bit of Typescript,

7
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,660
you don't need to know Typescript,

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:32,490
no worries

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:39,580
but in both languages so to say, we will use modern Javascript features and therefore, definitely go

10
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:40,880
through this refresher

11
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,290
if you're not sure if you got all these basics set, if you really are familiar with the latest Javascript

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:53,470
features or at least keep this module in mind so that you can come back to it if you later encounter

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:56,290
some syntax, some Javascript feature

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,050
you're just not sure about.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,390
So in this module, I'll briefly walk you through important next generation Javascript features, what they

16
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,060
do, why we use them and how we use them, so that we're all on the same page for the rest of this course.
